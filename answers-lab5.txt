Ex 1, Question 1:
    No, because iret will pop tf_eflags

Ex 2:
    exercise for the reader: why do we do this *after* reading the block in?
    Ans: it's logical to do it after TRANSACTION; process may panic because of sys_page_alloc then terminates ide_read, thus block should not be free... (?)
Ex 3: easy
Ex 4:
    file_block_walk WILL cause pgfault to alloc page if searching in indirect;
    f_indirect and f_direct all saves blockno.

Ex 5,6 : easy if read MOST of the file.c, serv.c fd.c
