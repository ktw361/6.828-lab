Exercise 1:
    similar to pages, using boot_alloc

Exercise 2:
    我的难处：load_icode() 居然还要用lcr3？ 有没有更巧妙的办法？PageInfo？
    我没想出来的：
        env_setup_vm 里面， 居然直接memcpy kern_pgdir就可以了，本来我还想一行一行复制。

Exercise 3:
    Reading

Exercise 4:
    暂时屏蔽Welcome to JOS kernel的颜色输出

*Challenge* 完成（？），仿照xv6
    Answer to Questions：
        1.  each individual hander pushes a DIFFERENT TRAPNO, and some provide
            errorno if processor does not.
        2. No.
         By Intel Developer's Manual 3A, Interrupt 13:
         General Protection Exception occurs when:
            "Executing the INT n instruction when the CPL is greater than the DPL of
            the referenced interrupt, trap, or task gate."

        No errorno, no cr0 set, when kernel allows softint's int 14

Exercise 5 & 6:
    T_BRKPT: not sure, but pass the grade
    Answer to Questions:
        3. SETGATE dpl 3 for T_BRKPT
        4. Protect Kernel from being violated by malicious user-level code

Exercise 7:
    make sure env.c: load_icode set *region_alloc and memset* address correctly
        especially ph->p_memsz / ph->p_filesz are easily confused.

Challenge:
    Not yet, TODO
Exercise 8: Easy
Exercise 9: Easy
