Ex 8:
    Always set EOP in any single packet descriptor;
    Syscall_e1000_try_transmit Only allow [data, data+len) to stay in same page.
    So no E_TXD_LEN_OV will occur.

Answers To Question:
    Syscall accept (data, len), where data region is within single page.
    e1000_transmit() reads tail index, check DD bit if RS is set and construct descriptor
    from argument addr and length. For every descriptor, EOP bit is set, as well as RS
    bit, which mean caller have to segment packet into page granularity.

    If transmit ring is full, e1000_transmit() simply returns -E_TXD_FULL, and
    sys_e1000_try_transmit() will pass this return value to user space, like what sys_ipc_try_send() do.
    output() will thus block and re-transmit packet if it sees -E_TXD_FULL, like what ipc_send() do.
