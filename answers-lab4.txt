Exercise 1 & 2:
    Questions answer:
        1. Since the mpentry.S code and loaded not linked, their address will start from zero, if not using MPBOOTPHYS.

Ex 3, 4, 5:
    Question
        2. One cpu modify kernel of another cpu, e.g. another cpu's Env.

Ex 6:
    Question
        3. Because e is allocated in envs, which is static mapped to same virtual address in every page directory.
        4. Each env's associated registers are Context of that env. Saving is done by _alltraps.

Ex 7:   Done

Part B:
Ex 8, 9, 10, 11:
    In ex10 , first decrement tf->tf_esp by 4, then change it to point to EXCEPTION stack.
    in pfentry.S, UTrapframe's fault_va and error_code is skipped (addl $8 %esp). Magic Number $40, $8 is calculated by watch the size of PushRegs and other parameters in UTrapframe(sizeof(UTrameframe) = 52, sizeof(PushRegs) = 8*4 = 32)
